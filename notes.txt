story 1 - Attributes

- there are 9 attributes:
  INT Intelligence
  REF Reflexes
  TECH Technical Ability
  COOL Cool
  ATTR Attractiveness
  LUCK Luck
  MA Movement Allowance
  BODY Body
  EMP Empathy
- there are 3 ways to generate them, but for now we will support 2:
  - roll 9d10 and assign them
  - set the point limit and assign them
  - [roll 9(d8+2), then assign the rolls]
- calculated attributes
  - RUN=MA*3
  - Jump=RUN/4
  - BTM is a BODY lookup:
    2   -> 0
    3-4 -> -1
    5-7 -> -2
    8-9 -> -3
    10+ -> -4
  - SAVE=BODY
  - Lift = Body * 40 kg

Implementation
1. Top of the control is "How", bottom is the details
2. How is basically
  - an input field (number only, 40-80 range)
  - a "Roll" button: rolls 9d10, sets the input to that value
3. The details section has the 9 attributes (4-4-(1+calculated) layout), each attribute has
  - short name
  - label with the current value
  - a plus and a minus button to set the value
  - the plus buttons active only if the remaining Characer points are > 0


story 2 - Skills

- character has 40 points to distribute amongst a list of 10 skills (one of the being special ability)
- minimum value is 0, max is 10
- then the character has INT + REF spill point to distribute amongs any other skill except:
  - career skills
  - any other role's special skills

story 3 - Lifepath

- style
  - roll for all button
  - select/roll individual items
- family background
  - roll for all
  - select/roll individual items
  - family rank
  - parents + [something happened to your parents]
  - family status + [family tragedy]
  - childhood env
  - siblings
- motivations
- lifepath
  - Roll 2D6+16 to determine your character's age, or pick any age 16 or greater - rerolls lifepath
  - for every year, roll d10:
    1-3 Big Problems, Big Wins
    4-6 Friends & Enemies
    7-8 Romantic Involvement
    9-10  Nothing Happened That Year

  - option to reroll the whole lifepath
  - for all year, do the rolls and show the result (with the option of adding notes)


- deployment to RedHat OpenShift
 - production server stuff (connect static maybe?)
 - how to run dev/prod server depending on NODE_ENV

------ this is where we are at --------------------------------

 - rewrap build process in gulp:
  - download framework code
  - tree shaking
  - minify
  - uglify
 - figure out docker images, etc on the linux VM
 - deploy prod to openshift

- export/import functionality using https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/
- download and require all framework items for working offline


----- MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT ----------------------------------

story 4 - Add login, list of characters page and some server side stuff with it

- server side aauth filter on all pages. base64 should be ok.
  - unauthenticated users go to login page
  - authenticated users go to main page
- login page: simple login page, cloning vat picture in the background
  - accepts google and facebook login tokens, no registration
  - user id is email address
- main page: list of characters user id has. Campaign management is a later phase, for now we only support chaacter generation/modification by user
  - list of characters, edit and delete hover buttons/links
  - "create new" option on top/bottom
- character page (whatever we have now as index): "save" and "cancel" needs to be added

story 5 - Equipment
story 6 - cyber stuff

----- Technological debt --------------------------------------

- better paging/navigation
  - Potential replacements:
    - vue router
    - bulma paging hack
    - bulma card
    - bulma menu
  - to be done once we have the app level navigation figured out. Same design would be good enough

----- Other notes ---------------------------------------------
